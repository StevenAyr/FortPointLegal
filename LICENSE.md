### LICENSE

Some people believe that you can hold a copyright in legal documents(case in point: all the enormous books of template contracts law firms shell out thousands of dollars for, which are always covered in copyright notices), even things as utilitarian as contracts, notices, and statutory elections. I’m a big fan of my own legal writing, but as a general matter I don’t think that legal documents have the [creative juice](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/copyrightable-subject-matter) to qualify for copyright protection. If you’d like to discuss, or better yet, argue about this point, by all means reach out, that would be great.

Nevertheless, in the interest of people who get nervous about that sort of thing, to the extent there is any copyright interest held in the documents contained in this repository, that interest is relinquished and these documents are submitted to the public domain in accord with [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0).
