### Readme

This repo is maintained by Steven M. Ayr of Fort Point Legal PC in Boston, MA. These documents are provided in part for transparency, because legal documents shouldn’t be some guarded secret you need to pay for access to, and in part for collaboration, so that by opening up our standard incorporation documentation we can solicit feedback and work with the community towards improvements. All feedback is welcome.

You can find out more about Fort Point Legal by visiting our website at <www.fortpointlegal.com>, or following us on Twitter at @FortPointLegal or @StevenAyr.

### Obligatory Legal Disclaimer

This website and these documents may be considered “advertising” under Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:07, and are considered “advertising” under the ethical rules of the State of Connecticut. I made this repository because I want you to have some general information, but it would also be great if you hired me.

Of course, this repository is for general information only, and is not legal advice. I can only dispense legal advice after meeting with you, getting a complete view of your situation, and signing a formal retainer agreement. You wouldn’t want me handing out legal advice willy nilly anyways.

Simply accessing this site and reading its contents does not create an attorney-client relationship between us. That would be a rather disfunctional relationship. There are various rules that govern whether information given to an attorney is considered confidential but they all share a common thread: there has to be an attorney-client relationship. Since there’s no relationship until we agree that one exists, any unsolicited communication or documentation you send me is not going to be confidential. In other words, give me a call or shoot me an introductory email before getting into anything you wouldn’t want revealed. This should go without saying, but anything you post on this public repository is going to be public, and thus non-confidential.

And one last time with feeling: nothing in this repo is legal advice. To the extent that I give some information it’s just that, general information. Each case is different and the devil’s always in the details, so it’s impossible for me to give any advice without going through all the steps listed above.
