Re:	Subscription for Shares in *COMPANY NAME*

To Whom It May Concern:

I hereby subscribe for *NUMBER OF SHARES* (*# OF SHARES*) shares of common stock of *COMPANY NAME*, a *STATE OF INCORPORATION* corporation (the “**Company**”), subject to a Stock Restriction Agreement including a repurchase right in favor of the Company, in exchange for consideration of $*CONSIDERATION* in the aggregate, plus other good and valuable consideration, all of which consideration is agreed to be at least 100% of the fair market value of the percent interest.

All of the interest so received will be taken by me for my own account as an investment and not with a view to the distribution thereof.

It is understood that you will issue the interest without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “**Act**”); therefore, the interest may not be resold or transferred unless registered under the Act or unless an exemption from registration is available.

Very truly yours,


By, _____________________________
